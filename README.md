## Background ðŸ¤¯

When I was browsing random videos on YouTube, I stumbled upon a 5-second video featuring a donut spinning, created entirely from characters in the terminal. Inspired by this, I decided to create my own version. It took me a year to start working on it, but eventually, I gave it a shot! ðŸ˜…

During my journey, this article was incredibly helpful: [Donut Math by A1k0n](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html)

After reading it and applying my little knowledge of linear algebra, I managed to code the donut in just a few hours. Sure, I probably made a few mistakes along the way, but the donut was spinning, so I considered it good enough to show my family. ðŸ˜„ Unsurprisingly, their faces were a bit... unclear. But hey, at least I got to flex this project to my friends! ðŸ˜Ž

## Setup ðŸŒ±

The setup is as simple as it gets!

1. Open your terminal/command prompt and Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you cloned the DonutC repository.
2. Compile the code: `gcc spinning_donut.c -lm`
3. Run the executable: `./a.exe`
