A terminal-based 3D spinning donut made entirely of ASCII characters.  
Inspired by a short YouTube clip, I recreated it after discovering [Donut Math by A1k0n](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html).  
I wrote the code in a few hours using some linear algebra â€” a fun little project to impress friends and family. ðŸ˜„
